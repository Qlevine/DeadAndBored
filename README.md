# DeadAndBored
Talk as enemies while you are dead! Troll your friends or trick them into thinking you are alive and safe!

Heavily reliant on https://github.com/EBro912/SpectateEnemies.git (SpectateEnemies)

A lot of the code was based off https://github.com/ege-adam/MoreScreams.git (MoreEnemies)

Special thanks to Spectate Enemies by **EBro912** and More Screams by **ege-adam** as that is where most of this code was built from

How To Use:
When dead and spectating an enemy (non-players), press the "Key To Talk" key (**default is Y**) and your audio will become proximity based at the center of the enemy. Let go of the "Key To Talk" key and you should once again be able to talk in the dead players lobby.
