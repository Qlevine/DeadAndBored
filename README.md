### Description
- Talk as enemies while you are dead! Troll your friends or trick them into thinking you are alive and safe!

### Installation
- Install BepinEx.
- Place BepInEx/plugins/DeadAndBored.dll in your BepInEx/plugins folder.
- Make sure everyone has the mode

### Usage
- Look at Spectate Enemies (https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AllToasters/SpectateEnemies/) to learn how to use that mod
- Press the "Key To Talk" key (**Default is Y**) while spectating an enemy to talk with proxmity chat from the center of that enemy. 
- Release the same key to talk in the dead players lobby.

### Keybind Defaults

- "Key To Talk" : Y
- "Key to Reset Audio Data" : U --- Shouldn't need this but in case someone can't hear someone else, have the person who can't hear, press this (this includes if someone can't hear others talking as monsters)

### Special Thanks
- Heavily reliant on https://github.com/EBro912/SpectateEnemies (SpectateEnemies)
- Requires https://github.com/steven4547466/LC-API (LC-API)
- A lot of the code was based off https://github.com/ege-adam/MoreScreams (MoreScreams)

Special thanks to Spectate Enemies by **EBro912**, More Screams by **ege-adam**, and LC-API by **steven4547466** as these mods are where most of this code is built from
